TITLE
A grammar to parse a file into Pod and Code sections.

INTRODUCTION

I want to create a semi-literate Raku source file with the extension .sl.
Then, I will weave it to generate a readable file in formats like Markdown,
PDF, HTML, and more. Additionally, I will tangle it to create source code
without any Pod6.

  Convenient tokens

Let's create four tokens for convenience.

        8|     my token hws            {    <!ww>\h*       } # Horizontal White Space
        9|     my token leading-ws     { ^^ <hws>          } # Whitespace at start of line
       10|     my token optional-chars {    \N*?           }
       11|     my token rest-of-line   {    \N*   [\n | $] }
       12|     my token ws-till-EOL    {    <hws> [\n | $] }
       13|     my token blank-line     { ^^ <ws-till-EOL>  }


To do this, I need to divide the file into Pod and Code sections by parsing
it. For this purpose, I will create a dedicated Grammar.

The Grammar

       14| #use Grammar::Tracer;
       15| grammar Semi::Literate is export {


Our file will exclusively consist of Pod or Code sections, and nothing
else. The Code sections are of two types, a) code that is woven into the
documentation, and b) code that is not woven into the documentation. The
TOP token clearly indicates this.

       16|     token TOP {
       17|         [
       18|           || <pod>
       19|           || <woven-code>
       20|           || <non-woven-code>
       21|         ]*
       22|     } # end of token TOP


  The Pod6 delimiters

According to the documentation,

Every Pod6 document has to begin with =begin pod and end with =end pod.


So let's define those tokens.

    The begin-pod token

       23|     token begin-pod {
       24|         <leading-ws>
       25|         '=' begin <hws> pod
       26|         <ws-till-EOL>
       27|     } # end of token begin-pod


    The end-pod token

The end-pod token is much simpler.

       28|     token end-pod { <leading-ws> '=' end <hws> pod <ws-till-EOL> }


    Replacing Pod6 sections with blank lines

Most programming applications do not focus on the structure of the
executable file, which is not meant to be easily read by humans. Our tangle
would replace all the Pod6 blocks with a single \n. That can clump code
together that is easier read if there were one or more blank lines.

However, we can provide the option for users to specify the number of empty
lines that should replace a pod block. To do this, simply add a Pod6
comment immediately after the =begin pod statement. The comment can say
anything you like, but must end with a digit specifying the number of blank
lines with which to replace the Pod6 section.

       29|     token num-blank-line-comment {
       30|         <leading-ws>
       31|         '=' comment
       32|         \N*?
       33|         $<num-blank-lines> = (\d+)?
       34|         <ws-till-EOL>
       35|     } # end of token num-blank-line-comment


  The Pod token

Within the delimiters, all lines are considered documentation. We will
refer to these lines as plain-lines. Additionally, it is possible to have
nested Pod sections. This allows for a hierarchical organization of
documentation, allowing for more structured and detailed explanations.

It is also permissible for the block to be empty. Therefore, we will use
the 'zero-or-more' quantifier on the lines of documentation, allowing for
the possibility of having no lines in the block.

       36|     token pod {
       37|         <begin-pod>
       38|         <num-blank-line-comment>?
       39|             [<pod> || <plain-line>]*
       40|         <end-pod>
       41|     } # end of token pod


  The Code tokens

The Code sections are similarly easily defined. There are two types of Code
sections, depending on whether they will appear in the woven code. See
below for why some code would not be included in the woven code.

    Woven sections

These sections are trivially defined. They are just one or more
plain-lines.

       42|     token woven-code  {
       43|         [
       44|             || <plain-line>
       45|         ]+
       46|     } # end of token woven-code


    Non-woven sections

Sometimes there will be code you do not want woven into the document, such
as boilerplate code like use v6.d;. You have two options to mark such code.
By individual lines or by delimited blocks of code.

       47|     token non-woven-code {
       48|         [
       49|           || <one-line-no-weave>
       50|           || <delimited-no-weave>
       51|         ]+
       52|     } # end of token non-woven


    One line of code

Simply append # begin-no-weave at the end of the line!

       53|     token one-line-no-weave {
       54|         ^^ \N*?
       55|         '#' <hws> 'no-weave-this-line'
       56|         <ws-till-EOL>
       57|     } # end of token one-line-no-weave


    Delimited blocks of code

Simply add comments # begin-no-weave and #end-no-weave before and after the
code you want ignored in the formatted document.

       58|     token begin-no-weave {
       59|         <leading-ws>                    # optional leading whitespace
       60|         '#' <hws> 'begin-no-weave'  # the delimiter itself (# begin-no-weave)
       61|         <ws-till-EOL>               # optional trailing whitespace or comment
       62|     } # end of token <begin-no-weave>
       63| 
       64|     token end-no-weave {
       65|         <leading-ws>                    # optional leading whitespace
       66|         '#' <hws> 'end-no-weave'    # the delimiter itself (#end-no-weave)
       67|         <ws-till-EOL>               # optional trailing whitespace or comment
       68|     } # end of token <end--no-weave>
       69| 
       70|     token delimited-no-weave {
       71|         <begin-no-weave>
       72|             <plain-line>*
       73|         <end-no-weave>
       74|     } # end of token delimited-no-weave
       75| 
       76|     token code-comments {
       77|             <leading-ws>
       78|             '#' <rest-of-line>
       79|         <!{ / <begin-no-weave> | <end-no-weave> / }>
       80|     } # end of token code-comments


    The plain-line token

The plain-line token is, really, any line at all... ... except for one
subtlety. They it can't be one of the begin/end delimiters. We can specify
that with a Regex Boolean Condition Check.

       81|     token plain-line {
       82|         :my $*EXCEPTION = False;
       83|         [
       84|           ||  <begin-pod>         { $*EXCEPTION = True }
       85|           ||  <end-pod>           { $*EXCEPTION = True }
       86|           ||  <begin-no-weave>    { $*EXCEPTION = True }
       87|           ||  <end-no-weave>      { $*EXCEPTION = True }
       88|           ||  <one-line-no-weave> { $*EXCEPTION = True }
       89|           || $<plain-line> = [^^ <rest-of-line>]
       90|         ]
       91|         <?{ !$*EXCEPTION }>
       92|     } # end of token plain-line


And that concludes the grammar for separating Pod from Code!

       93| } # end of grammar Semi::Literate


The Tangle subroutine

This subroutine will remove all the Pod6 code from a semi-literate file
(.sl) and keep only the Raku code.

       94| #TODO multi sub to accept Str & IO::PatGh
       95| sub tangle (


The subroutine has a single parameter, which is the input filename. The
filename is required. Typically, this parameter is obtained from the
command line or passed from the subroutine MAIN.

       96|     Str $input-file!,


The subroutine will return a Str, which will be a working Raku program.

       97|         --> Str ) is export {


First we will get the entire Semi-Literate .sl file...

       98|     my Str $source = $input-file.IO.slurp;


  Clean the source

    Remove unnecessary blank lines

Very often the code section of the Semi-Literate file will have blank lines
that you don't want to see in the tangled working code. For example:

                                                    # <== unwanted blank lines
                                                    # <== unwanted blank lines
        sub foo () {
            { ... }
        } # end of sub foo ()
                                                    # <== unwanted blank lines
                                                    # <== unwanted blank lines



So we'll remove the blank lines immediately outside the beginning and end
of the Pod6 sections.

       99|     my Str $cleaned-source = $source;
      100|     $cleaned-source ~~ s:g{\=end (\N*)\n+} =   "\=end$0\n";
      101|     $cleaned-source ~~ s:g{\n+\=begin (<hws> pod) [<hws> \d]?} = "\n\=begin$0";


  The interesting stuff

We parse it using the Semi::Literate grammar and obtain a list of
submatches (that's what the caps method does) ...

      102|     my Pair @submatches = Semi::Literate.parse($cleaned-source).caps;


...and iterate through the submatches and keep only the code sections...

      103| #    note "submatches.elems: {@submatches.elems}";
      104|     my Str $raku-code = @submatches.map( {
      105| #        note .key;
      106|         when .key eq 'woven-code'|'non-woven-code' {
      107|             .value;
      108|         }


    Replace Pod6 sections with blank lines

      109|         when .key eq 'pod' {
      110|             my $num-blank-lines =
      111|                 .value.hash<num-blank-line-comment><num-blank-lines>;
      112|             "\n" x $num-blank-lines with $num-blank-lines;
      113|         }
      114| 


... and we will join all the code sections together...

      115|     } # end of my Str $raku-code = @submatches.map(
      116|     ).join;


    Remove the no-weave delimiters

      117|     $raku-code ~~ s:g{ <leading-ws> '#' <hws> 'begin-no-weave'     <rest-of-line> }
      118|         = '';
      119|     $raku-code ~~ s:g{ <leading-ws> '#' <hws> 'no-weave-this-line' <rest-of-line> }
      120|         = "$0\n";
      121|     $raku-code ~~ s:g{ <leading-ws> '#' <hws> 'end-no-weave'       <rest-of-line> }
      122|         = '';


    remove blank lines at the end

      123|     $raku-code ~~ s{\n  <blank-line>* $ } = '';


And that's the end of the tangle subroutine!

      124|     return $raku-code;
      125| } # end of sub tangle (


The Weave subroutine

The Weave subroutine will weave the .sl file into a readable Markdown,
HTML, or other format. It is a little more complicated than sub tangle
because it has to include the code sections.

      126| sub weave (


  The parameters of Weave

sub weave will have several parameters.

    $input-file

The input filename is required. Typically, this parameter is obtained from
the command line through a wrapper subroutine MAIN.

      127|     Str $input-file!;


    $format

The output of the weave can (currently) be Markdown, Text, or HTML. It
defaults to Markdown. The variable is case-insensitive, so 'markdown' also
works.

      128|     Str :f(:$format) is copy = 'markdown';
      129|         #= The output format for the woven file.


    $line-numbers

It can be useful to print line numbers in the code listing. It currently
defaults to True.

      130|     Bool :l(:$line-numbers)  = True;
      131|         #= Should line numbers be added to the embeded code?


sub weave returns a Str.

      132|         --> Str ) is export {
      133| 
      134|     my UInt $line-number = 1;


First we will get the entire .sl file...

      135|     my Str $source = $input-file.IO.slurp;


    Remove blank lines at the begining and end of the code

EXPLAIN THIS!

      136|     my Str $cleaned-source = $source;
      137|     $cleaned-source ~~ s:g{\=end (\N*)\n+} =   "\=end$0\n";
      138|     $cleaned-source ~~ s:g{\n+\=begin (<hws> pod) [<hws> \d]?} = "\n\=begin$0";


  Interesting stuff

...Next, we parse it using the Semi::Literate grammar and obtain a list of
submatches (that's what the caps method does) ...

      139|     my Pair @submatches = Semi::Literate.parse($cleaned-source).caps;


...And now begins the interesting part. We iterate through the submatches
and insert the code sections into the Pod6...

      140| #    note "weave submatches.elems: {@submatches.elems}";
      141| #    note "submatches keys: {@submatchesÂ».keys}";
      142|     my Str $weave = @submatches.map( {
      143|         when .key eq 'pod' {
      144|             .value
      145|         } # end of when .key
      146| 
      147|         when .key eq 'woven-code' {qq:to/EOCB/; }
      148|             \=begin pod
      149|             \=begin code :lang<raku>
      150|              { my $fmt = ($line-numbers ?? "%3s| " !! '') ~ "%s\n";
      151|                 .value
      152|                 .lines
      153|                 .map($line-numbers
      154|                         ?? {"%4s| %s\n".sprintf($line-number++, $_) }
      155|                         !! {     "%s\n".sprintf(                $_) }
      156|                     )
      157|                 .chomp # get rid of the last \n
      158|              }
      159|             \=end code
      160|             \=end pod
      161|             EOCB
      162| 
      163|         when .key eq 'non-woven-code' {
      164|           ''; # do nothing
      165|           #TODO don't insert a newline here.
      166|         } # end of when .key eq 'non-woven-code'
      167| 


      168|     } # end of my Str $weave = @submatches.map(
      169|     ).join;


    remove blank lines at the end

      170|     $weave ~~ s{\n  <blank-line>* $ } = '';


And that's the end of the tangle subroutine!

      171|     return $weave
      172| } # end of sub weave (
