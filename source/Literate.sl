=TITLE An implementation of Semi-Literate programming for Raku with Pod6

=head1 INTRODUCTION
=comment 2

I want to create a semi-literate Raku source file with the extension
C<.sl>. Then, I will I<weave> it to generate a readable file in formats like
Markdown, PDF, HTML, and more. Additionally, I will I<tangle> it to create source
code without any Pod6.

To do this, I need to divide the file into C<Pod> and C<Code> sections by parsing
it. For this purpose, I will create a dedicated Grammar.

(See L<Useful::Regexes|https://github.com/deoac/Useful-Regexes> for the
    definitions of the named regexes used here. (C<<hws>> == Horizontal WhiteSpace))

=head1 The Grammar
=comment 2
=end pod


#use Grammar::Tracer;
grammar Semi::Literate is export does Useful::Regexes {

=begin pod

Our file will exclusively consist of C<Pod> or C<Code> sections, and nothing
else. The C<Code> sections are of two types, a) code that is woven into the
documentation, and b) code that is not woven into the documentation.  The
C<TOP> token clearly indicates this.

=end pod

    token TOP {
        [
          || <pod>
          || <code>
        ]*
    } # end of token TOP

    token code  {
        [
          || <non-woven>+
          || <woven>+
        ]
    } # end of token code

=begin pod
=comment 1

=head2 The Pod6 delimiters

According to the L<documentation|https://docs.raku.org/language/pod>,

=begin defn

    Every Pod6 document has to begin with C<=begin pod> and end with C<=end> pod.

=end defn

So let's define those tokens.
=head3 The C<begin-pod> token

=end pod


    token begin-pod {
        <leading-ws>
        '=' begin <hws> pod
        <ws-till-EOL>
    } # end of token begin-pod

=begin pod
=comment 1

=head3 The C<end-pod> token

The C<end-pod> token is much simpler.

=end pod

    token end-pod  {
        <leading-ws>
        '=' end <hws> pod
        <ws-till-EOL>
    } # end of token end-pod

=begin pod
=comment 1

=head2 Replacing Pod6 sections with blank lines

When we I<tangle> the semi-literate code, all the Pod6 will be removed.  This
would leave a lot of blank lines in the Raku code.  So we'll clean it up.
We provide the option for users to specify the number of empty
lines that should replace a C<pod> block. To do this, simply add a Pod6 comment
immediately after the C<=begin  pod> statement.  The comment can say anything
you like, but must end with a digit specifying the number of blank lines with
which to replace the Pod6 section.

=begin code :lang<raku>

    =begin pod
    =comment I want this pod block replaced by only one line 1
    ...
    =end pod

=end code
Here's the relevant regex:
=end pod

    token blank-line-comment {
        <leading-ws>
        '=' comment
        \N*?
        $<num-blank-lines> = (\d+)?
        <ws-till-EOL>
    } # end of token blank-line-comment

=begin pod
=comment 1

=head2 The C<Pod> token

Within the delimiters, all lines are considered documentation. We will refer to
these lines as C<plain-lines>. Additionally, it is possible to have nested
C<Pod> sections. This allows for a hierarchical organization of
documentation, allowing for more structured and detailed explanations.

It is also permissible for the block to be empty. Therefore, we will use the
'zero-or-more' quantifier on the lines of documentation, allowing for the
possibility of having no lines in the block.

=end pod

    token pod {
        <.begin-pod>
        <blank-line-comment>?
            [<pod> | <.plain-line>]*
        <.end-pod>
    } # end of token pod

=begin pod
=comment 1

=head2 The C<Code> tokens

The C<Code> sections are similarly easily defined.  There are two types of
C<Code> sections, depending on whether they will appear in the woven code.

=head3 Woven sections

These sections are trivially defined.
They are just one or more C<plain-line>s.

=end pod


    token woven  {
        [
            || <.plain-line>
        ]+
    } # end of token woven

=begin pod
=comment 1

=head3 Non-woven sections

Sometimes there will be code you do not want woven into the documentation, such
as boilerplate code like C<use v6.d;>.  You have two options to mark such code.
By individual lines or by a delimited block of code.

=end pod

    token non-woven {
        [
          || <.one-line-no-weave>
          || <.delimited-no-weave>
        ]+
    } # end of token non-woven
=begin pod
=comment 1

=head4 One line of code

Simply append C<# no-weave-this-line> at the end of the line!

=end pod

    regex one-line-no-weave {
        $<the-code>=(<leading-ws> <optional-chars>)
        '#' <hws> 'no-weave-this-line'
        <ws-till-EOL>
    } # end of token one-line-no-weave

=begin pod
=comment 1



=head4 Delimited blocks of code

Simply add comments C<# begin-no-weave> and C<#end-no-weave> before and after
the code you want ignored in the formatted document.

=end pod

    token begin-no-weave {
        <leading-ws>
        '#' <hws> 'begin-no-weave'
        <ws-till-EOL>
    } # end of token <begin-no-weave>

    token end-no-weave {
        <leading-ws>
        '#' <hws> 'end-no-weave'
        <ws-till-EOL>
    } # end of token <end--no-weave>

    token delimited-no-weave {
        <.begin-no-weave>
            <.plain-line>*
        <.end-no-weave>
    } # end of token delimited-no-weave


=begin pod
=comment 1

=head3 The C<plain-line> token

The C<plain-line> token is, really, any line at all...
... except for one subtlety.  They it can't be one of the begin/end delimiters.
We can specify that with a L<Regex Boolean Condition
Check|https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes\#Regex_Boolean_condition_check>.


=end pod

    token plain-line {
        :my $*EXCEPTION = False;
        [
          ||  <.begin-pod>         { $*EXCEPTION = True }
          ||  <.end-pod>           { $*EXCEPTION = True }
          ||  <.begin-no-weave>    { $*EXCEPTION = True }
          ||  <.end-no-weave>      { $*EXCEPTION = True }
          ||  <.one-line-no-weave> { $*EXCEPTION = True }
          || [^^ <rest-of-line>]
        ]
        <?{ !$*EXCEPTION }>
    } # end of token plain-line

=begin pod
=comment 1

And that concludes the grammar for separating C<Pod> from C<Code>!

=end pod

} # end of grammar Semi::Literate

=begin pod
=comment 2

=head1 The Tangle subroutine

This subroutine will remove all the Pod6 code from a semi-literate file
(C<.sl>) and keep only the Raku code.


=end pod

#begin-no-weave
#multi tangle ( Str $input-file!, Bool :v(:$verbose) ) {
#    tangle ($input-file.IO, :$verbose);
#} # end of multi tangle ( Str $input-file!, Bool :v(:$verbose) )
#end-no-weave

multi tangle (

=begin pod

The subroutine has a single parameter, which is the input filename. The
filename is required.  Typically, this parameter is obtained from the command
line or passed from the subroutine C<MAIN>.
=end pod
    Str $input-file!,
#    IO::Path $input-file!,

=begin pod
=comment 1
=head3 C<$verbose>
Use verbose only for debugging
=end pod
    Bool :v(:$verbose)      = False;
=begin pod

The subroutine will return a C<Str>, which will be a working Raku program.
=end pod
        --> Str ) is export {
=begin pod
=comment 1

First we will get the entire Semi-Literate C<.sl> file...
=end pod

    my Str $source = $input-file.IO.slurp;

=begin pod
=comment 1
=head2 Clean the source

=head3 Remove unnecessary blank lines

Very often the C<code> section of the Semi-Literate file will have blank lines
that you don't want to see in the tangled working code.
For example:

=begin code :lang<raku>

                                                # <== unwanted blank lines
                                                # <== unwanted blank lines
    sub foo () {
        { ... }
    } # end of sub foo ()
                                                # <== unwanted blank lines
                                                # <== unwanted blank lines

=end code
=end pod

=begin pod
=comment 1


So we'll remove the blank lines immediately outside the beginning and end of
the Pod6 sections.
=end pod

    my Str $cleaned-source = $source;
    $cleaned-source ~~ s:g{    \=end (\N*) \n+}      =  "\=end$0\n";
    $cleaned-source ~~ s:g{\n+ \=begin (<hws> pod) } = "\n\=begin$0";

=begin pod
=comment 1
=head2 The interesting stuff

We parse it using the C<Semi::Literate> grammar
and obtain a list of submatches (that's what the C<caps> method does) ...
=end pod

    my Pair @submatches = Semi::Literate.parse($cleaned-source).caps;

#    note "submatches.elems: {@submatches.elems}";
    my Str $raku-code = @submatches.map( {

=begin pod
=comment 1
=head3 Replace Pod6 sections with blank lines

=end pod


        when .key eq 'pod' {
            my $num-blank-lines =
                .value.hash<blank-line-comment><num-blank-lines>;
            "\n" x $num-blank-lines with $num-blank-lines;
        }

=begin pod
=comment 1

Add all the C<Code> sections.
=end pod

        when .key eq 'code' {
            .value;
        } # end of when .key eq 'code'

        # begin-no-weave
        default { die "Tangle: should never get here.
                    .key ==> {.key} .{.key}.keys => {.{.key}.keys}";
        } # end of default
        #end-no-weave
=begin pod
=comment 1

... and we will join all the code sections together...
=end pod

    } # end of my Str $raku-code = @submatches.map(
    ).join;

=begin pod
=comment 1
=head3 Remove the I<no-weave> delimiters

=end pod

    $raku-code ~~ s:g{
                        | <Semi::Literate::begin-no-weave>
                        | <Semi::Literate::end-no-weave>
                  } = '';

    $raku-code ~~ s:g{ <Semi::Literate::one-line-no-weave> }
                    = "$<Semi::Literate::one-line-no-weave><the-code>\n";

=begin pod
=comment 1
=head3 remove blank lines at the end

=end pod
    # remove blank lines at the end
    $raku-code ~~ s{\n  <blank-line>* $ } = '';

=begin pod
=comment 1

And that's the end of the C<tangle> subroutine!
=end pod
    return $raku-code;
} # end of sub tangle (

=begin pod
=comment 2

=head1 The Weave subroutine

The C<Weave> subroutine will I<weave> the C<.sl> file into a readable Markdown,
HTML, or other format.  It is a little more complicated than C<sub tangle>
because it has to include the C<code> sections.

=end pod

sub weave (

=begin pod
=comment 1
=head2 The parameters of Weave

C<sub weave> will have several parameters.
=head3 C<$input-file>

The input filename is required. Typically,
this parameter is obtained from the command line through a wrapper subroutine
C<MAIN>.

=end pod

    Str $input-file!;
=begin pod
=comment 1
=head3 C<$line-numbers>

It can be useful to print line numbers in the code listing.  It currently
defaults to True.
=end pod

    Bool :l(:$line-numbers) = True;
        #= Should line numbers be added to the embeded code?

=begin pod
=comment 1
=head3 C<$verbose>
Use verbose only for debugging
=end pod
    Bool :v(:$verbose)      = False;

=begin pod
C<sub weave> returns a Str.
=end pod

        --> Str ) is export {

    my UInt $line-number = 1;

=begin pod

=end pod

    my Str $source = $input-file.IO.slurp;

#TODO create a subroutine since this is used in both tangle and weave
    my Str $cleaned-source = $source;
    $cleaned-source ~~ s:g{    \=end (\N*) \n+}      =  "\=end$0\n";
    $cleaned-source ~~ s:g{\n+ \=begin (<hws> pod) } = "\n\=begin$0";

return False, so nothing will be printed for this line.
